If you have the GOG version of the game, do the following:
   * make a copy of `game.ins` (or `game.inst`) named `game.cue`
   * mount the `.cue` as a virtual CD (for example with `WinCDEmu`)
   * copy the `movie` folder from the mounted CD into NotBlood's folder
5. Launch NotBlood (on Linux, to play Cryptic Passage, launch with the `-ini CRYPTIC.INI` parameter)
